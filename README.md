# Typescript playground

Just simple repo prepared for putting any TS file to play with. Each file you create (should be in `src` folder) can be run using:

```
npm run ts src/index.ts
```

## Formatting

Repo has pre-configured linter and prettier to format files fine. When using Visual Studio Code, formatting is done on focus change. Otherwise use `npm run format:changed` to format changed only files or `npm run format:all` to format all files.
